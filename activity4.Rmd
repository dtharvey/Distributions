#### The Binomial Distribution: ^13^C Atoms in Cholesterol

The figure on the right is a barplot that shows, for 100 molecules of cholesterol, the number that have 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 atoms of ^13^C as determined by mass spectrometry.

Q1. Is this data continuous or discrete? How do you know?

Q2. The data in this experiment follow a binomial distribution in which the probability of a particular outcome, $p(x)$, is given by the equation

$$p(x) = \frac{n!}{x!(n - x)!} \times p^{x} \times (1 - p)^{n - x}$$

where *n* is the number of carbons atoms in cholesterol (also called the size), *x* is the number of ^13^C atoms in a molecule, and *p* is the probability that a randomly selected carbon atom is ^13^C. Do some research to determine (a) the number of carbon atoms in cholesterol and (b) the probability that an atom of carbon is ^13^C. Adjust the sliders to these values and comment on the fit of the equation to the data.

Q3. The mean for a binomial distribution is equal to $n \times p$ and its standard deviation is equal to $\sqrt{n \times p \times (1-p)}$. Report the mean and the standard deviation for this data using your values for $n$ and $p$, and then download the data and then check your result by calculating the actual mean and standard deviation.
