<h4>The Poisson Distribution: Emission of Beta Particles from
<sup>40</sup>K</h4>
<p>The figure on the right is a barplot that shows the number of beta
particles emitted by a sample of <sup>40</sup>K during 365 consecutive
7-s intervals. In some intervals, no beta particles were emitted; in
other intervals, as many as 13 beta particles were emitted.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>. Although a barplot and a histogram look
similar, they are not interchangeable. A histogram is useful for
continuous data and a barplot is useful for discrete data. Why are the
results of beta emission considered discrete instead of continuous?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>. The data in this experiment follow a
Poisson distribution in which the probability of a particular outcome,
<span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span>, in a fixed period of time is
given by the equation <span class="math display">\[p(x) =
\frac{\lambda^x e^{-\lambda}}{x!}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is the average rate of beta
emission and where the exclamation point indicates the factorial
(e.g.Â <span class="math inline">\(3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 =
6\)</span>). For the Cu<sub><em>x</em></sub>S data we drew the
theoretical distribution as a smooth line, but here we show only a set
of points connected by line segments. Explain why we can display the
normal distribution as a smooth line, but cannot do so with a Poisson
distribution.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>. How does the shape of the Poisson
distribution change as you adjust the value of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> from 0 to 13?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 4</strong>. Use the slider to determine the value of
<span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> for this data. Use your
value of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> to calculate the
probability that a single beta particle is emitted, <em>p(x = 1)</em>.
Explain how to convert this probability into a number of events and
compare this result to the data in the figure.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 5</strong>. The mean for a Poisson distribution is
equal to <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> and its standard
deviation is equal to <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{\lambda}\)</span>. Report the mean and
standard deviation for this data using your value for <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> and then download the data and
check your result by calculating the actual mean and standard
deviation.</p>
