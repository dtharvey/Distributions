<h4>The Binomial Distribution: <sup>13</sup>C Atoms in Cholesterol</h4>
<p>The figure on the right is a barplot that shows, for 100 molecules of
cholesterol, the number that have 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 atoms of
<sup>13</sup>C, as determined by mass spectrometry.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>. Is this data continuous or discrete? How
do you know?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>. The data in this experiment follow a
binomial distribution in which the probability of a particular outcome,
<span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span>, is given by the equation
<span class="math display">\[p(x) = \frac{n!}{x!(n - x)!} \times p^{x}
\times (1 - p)^{n - x}\]</span> where <em>n</em> is the number of
carbons atoms in cholesterol (also called the size), <em>x</em> is the
number of <sup>13</sup>C atoms in a molecule, and <em>p</em> is the
probability that a randomly selected carbon atom is <sup>13</sup>C. The
exclamation point indicates the factorial (e.g.Â <span class="math inline">\(3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6\)</span>). Do some
research to determine (a) the number of carbon atoms in cholesterol and
(b) the probability that an atom of carbon is <sup>13</sup>C. Adjust the
sliders to these values and comment on the fit of the equation to the
data.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>. The mean for a binomial distribution is
equal to <span class="math inline">\(n \times p\)</span> and its
standard deviation is equal to <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{n
\times p \times (1-p)}\)</span>. Report the mean and the standard
deviation for this data using your values for <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, and then download the data and then
check your result by calculating the actual mean and standard
deviation.</p>
