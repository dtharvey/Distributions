<h4>The Normal Distribution: Copper/Sulfur Ratio in Copper (I)
Sulfide</h4>
<p>The figure on the right is a histogram for 62 measurements of
<em>x</em>, the ratio of the moles of copper to the moles of sulfur in
samples of Cu<sub><em>x</em></sub>S prepared by igniting Cu and S.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>. The value of <em>x</em> in
Cu<sub><em>x</em></sub>S is considered continuous. What does it mean to
say that <em>x</em> is continuous and why does this experiment yield
continuous data?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>. A histogram shows the frequency for a
range of possible outcomes, called a bin. The bin on the far-left, for
example, shows that one of the 62 trials has a value for <em>x</em> in
the range 1.760–1.775. Why do we need to bin the data to create a useful
histogram?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>. The data in this experiment follows a
normal distribution, which is described by the equation</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[p(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2
\pi}}e^{-(x - \mu)^2/(2 \sigma^2)}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> is the probability of
a given outcome, <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is the mean
(average), and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is the
standard deviation. The dashed line overlaid on the histogram shows the
normal distribution, as frequencies instead of probabilities, given the
mean and the standard deviation set by the sliders. Use the sliders to
explore how the mean and the standard deviation affect the normal
distribution’s position, width, and overall shape. Explain how your
observations are consistent with the equation for a normal
distribution.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 4</strong>. Adjust the mean and the standard
deviation to provide the best fit of the normal distribution equation to
the histogram. When you are satisfied with your fit, download the data
and calculate the experimental mean and standard deviation, Compare
these values to your estimated values from fitting the equation to the
data.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 5</strong>. A normal distribution assumes all
samples come from a population with a single mean and standard
deviation. Suppose these 62 samples come from two populations, one where
sulfur was used in excess and one where it was not. Describe the shape
of the resulting histogram.</p>
