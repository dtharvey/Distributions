<h4>The Uniform Distribution: Certification of Class A 10-mL
Pipettes</h4>
<p>The figure on the right is a histogram that shows the distribution of
the certified volumes for 1000 10-mL volumetric pipettes. The number of
pipets in each of the histogram’s bins is shown at the top of the bin. A
pipet’s certified tolerance is the range of volumes around the pipet’s
expected volume, which for a Class A 10-mL pipet is <span class="math inline">\(10.00 \pm 0.02\)</span> mL. A pipette with a
volume outside this range is discarded.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>. Is this data continuous or discrete? How
do you know?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>. This distribution is described as
uniform. What does it mean for a distribution to be uniform? What
happens to the shape of this distribution and the counts in each bin if
you increase or decrease the number of bins? Use the slider to check
your prediction.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>. For a uniform distribution, the mean is
<span class="math inline">\(\frac{a+b}{2}\)</span> and the standard
deviation is <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{\frac{1}{12}(a -
b)^2}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are, respectively, the distribution’s
largest and smallest values. Calculate the expected mean and standard
deviation for Class A 10-mL pipets and then download the data and check
your result by calculating the actual mean and standard deviation.</p>
