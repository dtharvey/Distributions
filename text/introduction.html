<p>The plots on the right show the distribution of results for four
experiments. Each plot shows the frequency of a particular outcome on
the <em>y</em>-axis as a function of possible outcomes on the
<em>x</em>-axis. These experiments are:</p>
<p><strong>Copper/Sulfur Ratio in Copper Sulfide</strong>. If you mix
powdered copper metal with a stoichiometric excess of powdered sulfur
and ignite them in a crucible, copper (I) sulfide forms with an
empirical formula of Cu<sub><em>x</em></sub>S. The value of <em>x</em>
is determined by weighing the Cu before ignition and then determining
the mass of Cu<sub><em>x</em></sub>S when the reaction is complete; any
excess sulfur is removed as <span class="math inline">\(\require{mhchem}
\ce{SO2}\)</span>. The plot in the upper-left corner shows the
distribution of the values of <em>x</em> for 62 trials.</p>
<p><strong>Emission of Beta Particles from <sup>40</sup>K</strong>. In
beta emission, an unstable neutron decays into an electron and a proton.
The proton remains in the nucleus, which increases the atomâ€™s atomic
number by one; the electron is ejected as a beta particle. The plot in
the upper-right corner shows the distribution of the number of beta
particles emitted from a single sample of <sup>40</sup>K during each of
365 consecutive 7-s intervals.</p>
<p><strong>Certification of Class A 10-mL Pipettes</strong>. A class A
pipette delivers a calibrated volume of liquid. Each pipet has a unique
identification number and carries a certificate that states its precise
calibrated volume traced to a NIST-approved standard. The plot in the
lower-left corner shows the distribution of calibrations for 1000 Class
A 10-mL pipettes.</p>
<p><sup><strong>13</strong></sup><strong>C Atoms in
Cholesterol</strong>. Carbon has two stable isotopes: <sup>12</sup>C and
<sup>13</sup>C. Because <sup>12</sup>C is much more abundant than
<sup>13</sup>C, most organic molecules have no atoms of <sup>13</sup>C;
a few molecules, however, will contain one or more atoms of
<sup>13</sup>C. The plot in the lower-right corner shows the
distribution of the number of <sup>13</sup>C atoms in 100 molecules of
cholesterol.</p>
<p>Each of these four distributions has a different shape and structure,
and, therefore, a different mathematical form. Before continuing, take a
moment to make note of the similarities and differences in the pattern
of the data in these data sets, and in the way these data sets are
presented.</p>
