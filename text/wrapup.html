<h4>Source of Data</h4>
<p>Of the four data sets in this module, only the
Cu<sub><em>x</em></sub>S data is from an actual experiment (completed by
students at DePauw University in the 1990s). See <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0040-6031(00)00545-1">Blanchnik, R.;
Müller, A. “The Formation of Cu<sub><em>x</em></sub>S From the Elements
I. Copper Used in Form of Powders,” Thermochim. Acta, 2000, 361,
31-52</a> for a discussion of some of the factors that affect the
formation of non-stoichiometric copper sulfide.</p>
<p>The other three data sets were created using <code>R</code> to
simulate samples drawn at random from (a) a poisson distribution using a
<span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> of 5 particles per 7
seconds (<span class="math inline">\(n = 365\)</span> samples) and the
<code>rpois()</code> function, (b) a uniform distribution using a
minimum value of 9.98 and a maximum value of 10.02 (<span class="math inline">\(n = 1000\)</span> samples) and the
<code>runif()</code> function, and (c) a binomial distribution using a
size of 27, a probability of 0.0111 (<span class="math inline">\(n =
100\)</span> samples), and the <code>rbinom()</code> function. All three
of these data sets, however, are representative of the expected results
for these systems.</p>

<h4>Other Types of Distributions</h4>
<p>There are others types of distributions, one of which is an
exponential distribution where the probability of an event, <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span>, as a function of time, <em>t</em>,
is given by the equation <span class="math display">\[p(x) = \lambda
e^{-\lambda t}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is the average rate at which the
event occurs. The simulated emission of beta particles from
<sup>40</sup>K, which we considered earlier using a Poisson
distribution, has an average rate of 5 particles per 7 seconds, or 0.714
particles/second. The figure on the right shows a histogram of the
distribution of elapsed times between the emission of beta particles
with an overlay of the expected distribution using the equation above.
The most common elapsed time is between 0 and 1 seconds, and there is
little likelihood of a delay exceeding 8 seconds. Interestingly, the
individual rates of beta emission follow a discrete distribution and the
individual times between emission follow a continuous distribution.</p>
