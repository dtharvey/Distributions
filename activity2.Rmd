#### Emission of Beta Particles from ^40^K

The figure on the right is a barplot of the results for the emission of beta particles from ^40^K in 7-s intervals. A barplot shows the frequency of beta emission, which ranges from intervals in which no beta particles were emitted to intervals in which as many as 13 beta particles were emitted.

Q1. Although a barplot and a histogram look similar, they are not interchangeable. A histogram is useful for continuous data and a barplot is useful for discrete data. Why are the results of beta emission considered discrete instead of continuous?

The data in this experiment follow a Poisson distribution in which the probability of a particular outcome, $p(x)$, in a given period of time, such as 7 s, is given by the equation

$$p(x) = \frac{\lambda^x e^{-\lambda}}{x!}$$

where $\lambda$ is the outcome's average rate and where the exclamation point indicates the factorial.

Q2. For the Cu~*x*~S data we drew the theoretical distribution as a line, but here we show only a set of points. Explain why we can display a normal distribution as a line, but cannot do so with a Poisson distribution.

Q3. Use the slider to determine the value of $\lambda$ for this data. Use your value of $\lambda$ to calculate the probability that a single beta particle is emitted, *p(x = 1)*. Compare this probability to the barplot and explain how to convert your probability into a number of events.

Q4. How does the shape of the Poisson distribution change as you adjust the value of $\lambda$ from 0 to 13?

Q5. This data was collected using intervals of 7 s, which seems like an arbitrary choice. What problems might we expect if we used an interval of 1 s? What problems might we expect if we used an interval of 15 s?
