# Distributions of Data
 
Students are introduced to four common distributions of experimental data: the normal distribution, the Poisson distribution, the uniform distribution, and the binomial distribution. Each distribution is modeled using a data set that is either real or simulated. The mathematical model for each distribution is presented and students can adjust a model's parameters to fit the mathematical model to the data. The data sets can be downloaded as .csv spreadsheet files.
