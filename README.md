# Distributions
 
A multi-page application in a more active-learning format that relates the visual observations of the results of four experiments—one of which is data collected by students and three that are simulations—with the mathematical form of the distribution of their results. The types of distributions considered are normal, binomial, uniform, and Poisson.
